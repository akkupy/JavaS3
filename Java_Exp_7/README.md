### List Of Programs and Output for Experiment 7.

[square_cube_thread.java](https://github.com/akkupy/JavaS3/blob/master/Java_Exp_7/square_cube_thread.java) - Write a Java program that implements a multi-threaded program which has three threads. First thread generates a random integer every 1 second. If the value is even, second thread computes the square of the number and prints. If the value is odd the third thread will print the value of cube of the number.
```
How Many Random Integers needed : 5
Set the limit upto which random numbers should be generated : 10
The random integer: 3
Cube of 3 = 27
The random integer: 1
Cube of 1 = 1
The random integer: 2
Square of 2 = 4
The random integer: 9
Cube of 9 = 729
The random integer: 2
Square of 2 = 4
